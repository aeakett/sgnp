<li>The PCs are lovable evangelists who have switched bodies and who, with crossbows, fight werewolves for the last donut. Add robots and/or ninjas to taste.</li>
<li>The PCs are masked fanatics in an imaginary third-world country who, with honor, fight pod people for the sled they had when they were little in a bygone era.</li>
<li>The PCs are dancing philosophers in schoolgirl uniforms who, with the help of their fan club, fight whatever needs fighting for more wealth than you could imagine, but only at night.</li>

<li>The PCs are alcoholic Supreme Court justices in a world in which they simply don't belong who, with only themselves to blame, fight their rivals for political favors to a soundtrack of classic hits from the Sixties.</li>
<li>The PCs are kidnapped slaves on a space station who, with no other options, fight organized crime for all the wrong reasons like in that movie.</li>
<li>The PCs are cowardly conspiracy theorists in a beat-up station wagon who, with a hilarious and talented NPC, fight goblins for drugs to a block-rockin' beat.</li>
